    <h1>Map</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Opens a map of the available sites. As with many commercial map interfaces, users can pan with the
        mouse and zoom with the scroll wheel. Clicking sites on the map or selecting them with the lasso tool
        (upper right corner of the map) will add them to the &#39;sites&#39; selector. The "Deselect All" button will
        remove all sites from the &#39;sites&#39; selector.</p>
